General

Design teams for grunts in Overlook Cliff 1, Normal forest 2, Town 2. (All accessable before beating bug guy)[check events to see how many]

Figure out how to do scripted events (for example when the aqua grunts all march into the oceanic museum)

See if day night cycle is possible visually

Add east and west arrow warps for water

See if random weather is possible and if I need to copy maps for it

See if possible for trainers to drop berries instead of money

Figure out how spawn levels work (i.e. how to set levels for the pokemon in the grass)

Ask me about "Legendaries"

Ask me about nuzlocke mode features.
