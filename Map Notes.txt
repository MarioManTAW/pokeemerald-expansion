(Rustboro Tileset) Beach Hut and Devon Co building moved to Slateport Tileset in place of all contest hall assets and if necessary the oceanic museum. 

Move hot springs from lavridge tileset to fallarbor tileset over contest hall

Add encounter sand from mauvile tileset to slateport tileset

Add stairs to ship in fallarbor tileset

Add white glass display case from facility tileset to generic building tileset


Assets to be altered

Make ledge tile with dark grass and mountain texture.

Change some of mauville tileset flowers to be dark grass

Make dark grass assets of secret base tree(both vine and lower non vine variants [normal has no background on top two tiles so its fine]), grass ledges, small thin trees, and normal trees

Should add wear and tear to houses eventually

Buildings in Town 3 should have smeargle grafiti

See if rotating the stairs makes them convincing as sideways stairs.

See if rotating waterfalls to the right works.

Pirate ship (Inside tiles as well)
Berry Trees
Sideways stairs
Background for "PC"

General

Figure out how to do scripted events (for example when the aqua grunts all march into the oceanic museum)

See if day night cycle is possible visually


See if possible for trainers to drop berries instead of money


see if different modes (story and nuzlocke) are doable.
